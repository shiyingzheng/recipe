1. Make wheat bread dough and white bread dough using equal weights of flour
 	1.1 Make wheat bread dough as described in steps 1-4 in ./wheatBread  
 	1.2 Make white bread dough as described in steps 1-4 in ./whiteBread
Since the wheat dough takes twice as long to rise, we should make the wheat dough first. 
2. Roll out a flat slab of wheat dough, about 16 inches by 8 inches and half an inch thick. Roll about 3/4 inches of white dough over the wheat dough to cover the wheat dough completely. 
3. Turn dough over and roll up the dough, so the white dough is on the outside. Stretch the white dough over any exposed wheat dough.

4. At this point, we should have a log of dough. Fold the log in half so it resembles a ball. Pinch the dough together so it has no seam. Allow loaves to rise for an hour, covered with a wet towel. 
5. Score the loaves with a knife (i.e. cut shallow but long incisions at the top of the loaves). Bake loaves on trays lined with parchment paper at 400F until the inside is 180F as measured by the probe thermometer. The crust should look golden. Baking takes 20 - 40 mins depending on the size of the loaf and the type of oven. 
7. Allow loaves to cool before cutting open.
