Recipe for white bread, based on percentage of weight of wheat flour.
If using 15 lbs of flour, we can make enough bread for 50 people for two days of use. 

100% 	white flour 	15 		lbs
60% 	water 			9 		lbs
10% 	oil 			1.5 	lbs
2% 		sugar 			.3  	lbs
2% 		salt 			.3 		lbs
2% 		yeast 			.3  	lbs

1. Measure all water (warm, not hot). Put water in a bowl. Add yeast. Wait 10 mins. 
2. Add flour first into the mixture, then all the rest of the ingredients.
3. Mix ingredients, preferably with an industrial mixer, until the dough has absorbed all flour from the side of the bowl. The dough should form a ball and not be sticky. If it is still sticky, add half a cup of flour, and continue mixing. The dough should be soft and pliable. Try to mix as little as possible. 
4. Allow dough to rise for 1 hour, covered with wet towel. 
5. Form dough into balls about 8 inches in diameter. Allow loaves to rise for 1 hour, covered with wet towel.
6. Bake loaves on trays lined with parchment paper at 400F until the inside is 180F as measured by the probe thermometer. 
7. Allow loaves to cool before cutting open.
