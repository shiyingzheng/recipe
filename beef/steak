1 half-pound ribeye steak
salt
pepper
canola oil

1. Dry steak of excess moisture. 
2. Season steak with salt and pepper. 
3. Heat up the oven-safe stainless steel pan (do not use nonstick pan) over medium high heat. Test the correct heat by adding a little water to the pan. 
As described in http://www.livestrong.com/article/447488-how-to-cook-a-rib-eye-like-restaurants-do/, "You can test the correct heat of the pan by adding 1/8 teaspoon of water. If the water simply sizzles, the pan is not hot enough. If the water immediately breaks into a large number of small beads the pan is too hot. At the correct heat the water should form a large bead similar to mercury and bounce around the pan. "
4. Add enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan. Cook the steak in the pan, 4 mins on each side. At this point it should be medium rare. If well-done is prefered, put steak in the oven for 5 mins.
